## Overview

Lab 01 handed you the tools. This lab hands you a problem and gets out of your way.

Somewhere on The Grid, something is down. Your job is not to guess which thing — your job is to **find out**, one rung at a time, and then write down what the evidence says. This is the first time in this course you're being asked to do real diagnostic work rather than follow a recipe, and it is a genuine skill. You already have everything you need.

**The method is the Ladder Rule from Lesson 4:**

1. **Check yourself** — do you have a valid address?
2. **Check your gateway** — can you get out of your own neighbourhood?
3. **Check the target by NAME.**
4. **Check the target by IP.**
5. **Trace the path.**

*Work outward, one rung at a time, and let the evidence pick the culprit.*

The reason the ladder exists is that instinct is a terrible investigator. Instinct wants to name a villain in the first thirty seconds — "it's DNS," "it's the firewall," "it's the router" — and then spend an hour proving itself right. Evidence is slower and it is correct. **Do not decide what is broken until Part E.** Run the rungs in order, record what each one actually said, and let the finding assemble itself.

You will also be told, partway through, what somebody else thinks the problem is. Treat that the way you'd treat any other claim: test it.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations CLI Simulator (browser-based, inside the Lab Portal) |
| Shell | **bash** throughout this lab |
| Prerequisite | Week 5, Lessons 1–4 completed; Lab 01 completed first (this lab assumes those tools) |
| Commands used | `ip addr`, `ip route`, `ping`, `dig`, `traceroute` |

**Before you start:** log into the Lab Portal, open **Week 5 → CLI Simulator**, and load the **"The Grid — Outage Response (Bash)"** scenario. It boots you into the same workstation you used in Lab 01, on the same segment, with the same gateway. Only one thing about The Grid has changed since yesterday. Find it.

---

## Part A — Establish Your Baseline

Rungs 1 and 2 of the ladder. It is tempting to skip straight to the thing users complained about — resist that. If you don't establish that *your own machine and your own way out are healthy*, then every failure you find afterwards is ambiguous. You won't know whether the target is broken or whether you are.

### Step 1 — Check Yourself

Confirm your workstation still holds a valid address on The Grid, and that you know where its traffic leaves from.

Run `ip addr` for your address, then `ip route` for your gateway — the same two commands you used in Lab 01. (Remember: addresses and routes live in different places, so it takes both.)

The full `ip addr` output:

```
student@ivy-workstation:/home/student$ ip addr

```

The full `ip route` output:

```
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 02:1a:7c:44:0b:5e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.20.5.42/24 brd 10.20.5.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

Your IPv4 address and default gateway, pulled out of those two results:

```
IPv4 4: 10.20.5.42 and default gateway: 10.20.5.42
```

### Step 2 — Check Your Gateway

Ping your default gateway. This is the door out of your neighbourhood — if this fails, nothing past it means anything.

Command you ran:

```
student@ivy-workstation:/home/student$ ping 10.20.5.1
```

Output (the full ping result, including the summary line):

```

PING 10.20.5.1 (10.20.5.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from grid-gateway (10.20.5.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.000 ms
64 bytes from grid-gateway (10.20.5.1): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.200 ms
64 bytes from grid-gateway (10.20.5.1): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=1.100 ms
64 bytes from grid-gateway (10.20.5.1): icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=1.300 ms

--- 10.20.5.1 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3005ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.000/1.150/1.300/0.100 ms
```

### Step 3 — State What the Baseline Proves

Two healthy results is not "nothing happened." It's a finding, and it eliminates an entire category of causes before you've touched the target once.

What your baseline rules out, and why that matters before you go further:

```
My address is valid, and I can reach the gateway with 0% packet loss. Therefore, this machine and the local network is working fine. So whatever is broken has not been discovered yet. 
```

---

## Part B — Test the Target

Rungs 3 and 4. This is the fork in the road, and the two tests must be run **in this order** and read **as a pair**. Either one alone tells you almost nothing. Together they tell you almost everything.

### Step 1 — Test the Target by Name

Ping `relay-station.grid.local` — the host the Foundry staff say they can't reach.

Command you ran:

```
student@ivy-workstation:/home/student$ ping relay-station.grid.local
```

Output (the full ping result, including the summary line):

```
PING relay-station.grid.local (10.20.5.30) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- relay-station.grid.local ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 3005ms
```

### Step 2 — Read That Output Carefully Before You Move On

There are two separate things happening in a ping, and this output separates them for you. Look at the **first line**, then look at the **summary line**, and notice that they do not agree about whether things are going well.

Did the name turn into an IP address — and if so, which one? Then: what did the packet loss say?

```
The first line stated the the relay-station.grid.local displayed the IP address 10.20.5.30.The summary line displayed 100% packet loss, so 0 of 4 packets were received.
```

### Step 3 — Ask DNS Directly

Ping *told* you the name resolved, but it told you in passing, on one line, while it was busy doing something else. Ask the question on its own so the answer is unambiguous — and so you have it in writing when you escalate.

Run `dig relay-station.grid.local`.

Command you ran:

```
student@ivy-workstation:/home/student$ dig relay-station.grid.local
```

Output (the full dig result):

```
; <<>> DiG 9.18.24 <<>> relay-station.grid.local
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 41207
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;relay-station.grid.local.			IN	A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
relay-station.grid.local.	3600	IN	A	10.20.5.30

;; Query time: 1 msec
;; SERVER: 10.20.5.10#53(10.20.5.10)
```

Look at the `status:` field in the header and the `ANSWER SECTION`. Does DNS know this host, and if so, what address does it hand back?

What the status field said, and the A record it returned:

```
status: NOERROR
A	10.20.5.30
```

This is the single most quotable piece of evidence in the whole investigation, because it settles a question your colleague is about to raise.

### Step 4 — Test the Target by IP

Now take the IP address out of that first line and ping it directly: `10.20.5.30`. You are deliberately removing name lookup from the equation.

Command you ran:

```
student@ivy-workstation:/home/student$ ping 10.20.5.30

```

Output (the full ping result, including the summary line):

```
PING 10.20.5.30 (10.20.5.30) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- 10.20.5.30 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 3005ms
```

### Step 5 — State What the Combination Proves

Now put the two results side by side. The by-name test and the by-IP test each had a job:

- The by-name test asks: *can this name be turned into a number, and does that number answer?*
- The by-IP test asks: *forget names entirely — does that number answer?*

Work through it. If the name failed to become a number, that would point one direction. If the name became a number just fine but the number won't answer, that points somewhere else entirely. And if you removed the name from the equation altogether and the failure **didn't change**, then whatever is broken was never about the name.

What the two tests together prove — and, just as importantly, what they rule out:

```
When I looked up the name, it went to port 53 (DNS), and it worked. It came back with no error and gave me the IP address 10.20.5.30. The name and the number both checked out. When I pinged it by name and by number, both times I got 100% packet loss. Nothing changed either way, so it's definitely not a DNS issue. I got the address fine both times. Something else made that machine unreachable, because no packets came back at all. So together, these two tests prove the machine at 10.20.5.30 just isn't responding, and they rule out DNS and the name being the problem.
```

---

## Part C — Trace the Path

Rung 5. Ping tells you *whether* something answers. Traceroute tells you *how far your traffic got before it stopped* — it lists each hop along the way, and a row of `* * *` means the path died at that point.

One traceroute on its own is hard to read if you've never seen a healthy one. So you'll run two, and compare.

### Step 1 — Trace to the Broken Target

Run `traceroute relay-station.grid.local`.

Command you ran:

```
student@ivy-workstation:/home/student$ traceroute relay-station.grid.local
```

Output (the full trace, including the timeout rows):

```
traceroute to relay-station.grid.local (10.20.5.30), 8 hops max, 60 byte packets
  1  grid-gateway (10.20.5.1)  1.000 ms  1.200 ms  1.100 ms
  2  * * *
  3  * * *
  4  * * *
  5  * * *
  6  * * *
  7  * * *
  8  * * *
```

The last hop that answered, and what happened after it:

```
Last responding hop: hop 1, grid-gateway (10.20.5.1). After that, hops 2 through 8 were all * * * Every hop past the gateway timed out with no reply.
```

### Step 2 — Trace to a Known-Good Target for Comparison

Now trace to a host you have no reason to suspect — `cloud-heights.grid.local`, out on the far edge of The Grid. (You'll be spending a lot of time in Cloud Heights next week. Consider this an introduction.)

Command you ran:

```
student@ivy-workstation:/home/student$ traceroute cloud-heights.grid.local
```

Output (the full trace):

```
traceroute to cloud-heights.grid.local (10.20.7.80), 8 hops max, 60 byte packets
  1  grid-gateway (10.20.5.1)  1.000 ms  1.200 ms  1.100 ms
  2  grid-core (10.20.0.1)  4.000 ms  4.200 ms  4.100 ms
  3  cloud-heights.grid.local (10.20.7.80)  12.000 ms  12.200 ms  12.100 ms
```

The complete list of hops, in order:

```
  1  grid-gateway (10.20.5.1)  1.000 ms  1.200 ms  1.100 ms
  2  grid-core (10.20.0.1)  4.000 ms  4.200 ms  4.100 ms
  3  cloud-heights.grid.local (10.20.7.80)  12.000 ms  12.200 ms  12.100 ms
```

### Step 3 — Compare the Two Traces

The comparison is the whole point of running two. One trace completed and one didn't — and where each one stopped is the evidence.

Pay attention to whether the **first hop** was the same in both. If traffic to the broken target and traffic to the healthy target both got through the same first hop successfully, that tells you something specific about which part of the path is fine.

What the comparison tells you about where the problem is — and where it is not:

```
Both traces went through the gateway. You can clearly see that hop 1 answered on both. Hop 2 is where everything changed. Cloud-heights went straight through grid-core and on to hop 3, reaching cloud-heights.grid.local. The other one, relay-station, went straight to stars after hop 1. So the issue is not my machine, not the gateway, and it can't be the network because the other trace completed all three hops to its target.
```

## Part D — The Colleague's Theory

A more experienced colleague on the on-call channel reads your notes and jumps in:

> "Oh, I've seen this one. It's the relay station's DNS entry — it's `relay-station-old.grid.local` that everything actually points at, and that name is busted. This is a DNS problem, not a host problem. Go check it."

They sound confident. They may even be senior to you. **Test the claim anyway.** In security work, "somebody confident said so" is not evidence, and the fastest way to be respectfully wrong-footed is to accept a theory you could have checked in ten seconds.

### Step 1 — Test the Colleague's Host

Ping `relay-station-old.grid.local`.

Command you ran:

```
student@ivy-workstation:/home/student$ ping relay-station-old.grid.local
```

Output (the exact error or result — copy it precisely):

```
ping: relay-station-old.grid.local: Name or service not known
```

### Step 2 — Explain Why This Is a Different Kind of Failure

This result does **not** look like Part B. Compare them closely:

- In Part B, the name became a number, and then the packets went nowhere.
- Here, you never got a number at all.

Those are two genuinely different failures, at two different stages, and confusing them is one of the most common mistakes in network troubleshooting. In Lesson 2 you met the pair: **a name that doesn't resolve at all** versus **a name that resolves perfectly to a host that's dead**. One is the directory not having an entry. The other is the directory being completely correct about an address where nobody answers the door.

For context: `relay-station-old.grid.local` was decommissioned. It was retired on purpose, its directory entry was removed on purpose, and it has nothing to do with today's ticket. A retired name failing to resolve is *expected behaviour*, not an outage.

Explain, in your own words, why this failure is a different kind from the one in Part B — and why it is not the cause of today's outage:

```
The failure is different because it never gave me a number. I got name or service not known. So, if it was decommissioned, that means it has been retired; it cannot provide any data here. Therefore, there is no address to reach. 
```

### Step 3 — Say How You'd Reply to Your Colleague

You now know they're wrong. Being right is easy; being useful about it is a professional skill. Write the reply you'd actually send — polite, specific, and grounded in what you ran rather than in who's more senior. Point at the evidence, not at the person.

Your reply to your colleague:

```
I ran the checks and here's what they show. Relay-station resolves fine to 10.20.5.30, so DNS is working. But pinging it comes back 100% loss, and the traceroute dies right after the gateway. When I traced a healthy host on the same path, it completed every hop to its target. The network and DNS are both fine. The problem is the relay-station machine itself being unreachable.
```

### Step 4 — One Control Test Before You Write It Up

You are about to tell people something is broken. Before you do, prove that *not everything* is broken — otherwise the first question you'll be asked is whether the problem is you.

Ping a host you already know is healthy: `foundry-archive.grid.local`.

Command you ran:

```
student@ivy-workstation:/home/student$ ping foundry-archive.grid.local
```

Output (the full ping result):

```
PING foundry-archive.grid.local (10.20.5.20) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from foundry-archive.grid.local (10.20.5.20): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=2.000 ms
64 bytes from foundry-archive.grid.local (10.20.5.20): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=2.200 ms
64 bytes from foundry-archive.grid.local (10.20.5.20): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=2.100 ms
64 bytes from foundry-archive.grid.local (10.20.5.20): icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=2.300 ms

--- foundry-archive.grid.local ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3005ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 2.000/2.150/2.300/0.100 ms
```

Why this matters: a report that says "the relay station is unreachable" is weaker than one that says "the relay station is unreachable **while every other host I tested answers normally**." The second version has already ruled out the boring explanations, and it's the difference between a ticket that gets acted on and one that gets handed back to you.

### Step 5 — Capture Your Evidence (REQUIRED screenshot)

Take a screenshot of your simulator session showing your evidence trail — at minimum the failed ping by name, the successful `dig`, the failed ping by IP, and the failed traceroute. **This screenshot is required.** Name it `cli-grid-outage.png`. You'll upload it and record its filename via the GitHub Commit section below.

An incident note with no attached evidence is just an opinion. This is the attachment.

---

## Part E — Write the Finding

This is the part that makes you a security professional rather than someone who can run commands.

Everything you've done so far is raw evidence. Nobody upstream of you — not your team lead, not the Foundry staff who filed the ticket, not the person who picks this up on the next shift — is going to read six terminal outputs and work out the conclusion themselves. Your job is to hand them the conclusion **and** the reason to believe it.

This is your first incident-report rep. You will do many more; Week 12's capstone asks you to write these for real. So we're giving you the structure now, while the stakes are low. Fill in each field — this is not a blank page, it's a form, and every professional incident note answers these same four questions.

**Keep it short and specific.** A good finding is a paragraph, not an essay. Write what you can defend.

### Step 1 — What Is Broken

One or two sentences. Name the specific thing that is not working. Be precise about *what* is down — not "the network," not "the relay station area," but the actual component your evidence points at.

Your statement of what is broken:

```
The relay-station machine at 10.20.5.30 is down. It's not answering, even though everything on the way to it works.
```

### Step 2 — What Evidence Proves It

List the specific tests you ran and what each one returned. This is where your Parts B and C outputs earn their keep. Someone reading this should be able to re-run your tests and reach the same conclusion without asking you a single question.

Your evidence, test by test:

```
1. ping relay-station.grid.local - came back status NOERROR with the A record 10.20.5.30, so DNS works and the name is correct and it is 100% packet loss, no replies.
2. ping 10.20.5.30 (by number) — also 100% packet loss, so it's not a name problem.
3. traceroute relay-station.grid.local — got to the gateway at hop 1, then all stars, so it dies right after the gateway.
4. traceroute to a healthy host (cloud-heights, 10.20.7.80) — completed all the way through the same first hop, proving the path itself works.
```

### Step 3 — What You Ruled Out, and How

Just as important as what you found. Say explicitly which possible causes you eliminated and which specific test eliminated each one. At minimum, address: your own workstation, your local network path out, name resolution, and the colleague's theory.

Ruling out possibilities is what separates a finding from a guess. A reader who sees only your conclusion has to trust you. A reader who sees what you eliminated can *check* you.

What you ruled out and the evidence that ruled it out:

```
Ruled out my own machine because I have a valid address, and I pinged my gateway with 0% loss. DNS was ruled out because dig returned NOERROR and the correct IP. The name was ruled out because pinging by the number failed the same way. The network was ruled out because a healthy host completed its trace through the same gateway. 
```

### Step 4 — What Should Happen Next

One or two sentences. Based on your finding, who or what needs to be looked at, and by whom? You don't have the access to fix this yourself — and that's normal. Knowing exactly what to escalate, and to whom, is the deliverable.

Your recommended next step:

```
The relay-station 10.20.5.30 needs to be checked whether it is on and running. It should be escalated to someone to look at the server. Based on the evidence, this may be the machine that is down. 
```

---

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** In Part B you pinged the target by name and then by IP. Explain why running *both* is necessary — describe what a person would wrongly conclude if they had run only the by-name test and stopped there. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
Running both gives you solid evidence so that no conclusion is made. Looking at both data points gives you better clues to the real issue. I might have wrongly concluded it was a DNS or name problem without checking them both. Pinging by the number proved that the address itself doesn't answer, so the real issue has to be that the machine is down. 
```

**Analysis Question 2.** A name that returns "Name or service not known" and a name that resolves fine but never replies to a ping are two different failures with two different causes. Describe each one in plain English — what is actually going wrong in each case — and explain why treating them as the same problem would send a troubleshooter down the wrong path. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
"Name or service not known" means DNS has no entry for that name. Therefore, nothing ever gets sent. The problem is at the lookup stage. A name that resolves fine but never replies to a ping means DNS worked and gave a real address, but the machine at that address isn't answering. Treating them the same would be sending me or the technician down the wrong path. That would require further investigation. 
```

**Analysis Question 3.** Part A asked you to confirm your own address and your gateway before touching the reported problem at all — even though the ticket had nothing to do with your workstation. Defend that step to a colleague who thinks it's a waste of time on an urgent ticket. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
Testing my address is just best practice because it rules out things on my end. If the machine had a bad address or couldn't leave the gateway, then that could have been the problem. Starting there, helps me trust the next steps that follows.
```

**Analysis Question 4.** Your colleague was confident, possibly senior, and wrong. Describe how you decided their theory was wrong, and what you think that says about how much weight confidence should carry compared to evidence in security work. Where relevant, consider what would have happened if you had simply accepted their theory and reported it upward. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
I decided my colleague was wrong by testing their theory instead of just believing it. The evidence didn't match what they said. That shows evidence matters more than confidence. If I had reported their theory, the wrong thing gets escalated and the real problem stays broken. Evidence is more important than a theory.
```
