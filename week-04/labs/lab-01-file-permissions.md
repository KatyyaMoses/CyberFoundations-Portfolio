# Week 4 Lab — File Permissions: The Badge Audit (CLI Simulator)

**Student Name:** Katyya Moses

**Date Completed:** 8/5/2-26

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 4  
**Submission Path:** `week-04/labs/lab-01-file-permissions.md`

---

## Overview

Lesson 1 revealed what Ivy's badge rings mean: every file carries permissions — who may read, write, and execute it — and one wrongly-set ring can be a whole security incident. This lab has you run a small permissions audit of your own in the CLI Simulator: read the rings on a set of seeded files (Part A), fix three problems deliberately with `chmod` (Part B), and read the same story on the Windows side with `Get-Acl` (Part C). One screenshot from this lab becomes part of ★ Deliverable 1.

**Nothing here can break anything real.** The CLI Simulator is a consequence-free practice space — exactly the right place to change permissions for the first time.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations CLI Simulator (browser-based, inside the Lab Portal) — no install, no VM, no real terminal required |
| Shell | Parts A and B use **bash**; Part C uses **PowerShell** |
| Prerequisite | Week 4, Lesson 1 completed |

**Before you start:** log into the Lab Portal, open **Week 4 → CLI Simulator**, and load the **"Foundry District Badge Audit"** scenario. It seeds a small folder of files whose permissions have… issues. That's the point.

---

## Part A — Read the Rings

### Step 1 — Get the Security Report

Run the long listing (`ls -l`) in your starting folder. This is the same listing from Week 3's `ls`, with one flag added — and that flag turns it into a per-file security report.

Command you ran:

```
morgan@foundry:/home/morgan/badge-office$ ls -l
```

Output (the full listing):

```

-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    82 badge-codes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 cleanup.sh
-rw-rw-rw- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 shift-notes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    49 supply-list.txt
```

### Step 2 — Decode One File Completely

Pick any one file from your listing and decode its full permission string, audience by audience — owner, group, other — the way Lesson 1 decoded `-rwxr-xr--`. Write it as plain-English sentences ("the owner can…, the group can…, everyone else can…").

The file and its permission string:

```
master-inventory.txt

-rw-rw-rw-
```

Your plain-English decode:

```
the owner can:read and write
the group can:read and write
everyone else can:read and write
```

### Step 3 — Find the Problem File

One file in this folder is dramatically more permissive than it should be — every ring lit for every audience, or close to it. Find it. (Hint: scan the *other* triplet — the last three characters — down the whole listing. Which file gives strangers the most?)

The most permissive file and why you flagged it:

```
master-inventory.txt — its permission string was -rw-rw-rw-. Scanning the last three characters (the "other" triplet), it read rw-, meaning anyone outside the owner and group could both read and write the file. Every other file only gave "other" read access (r--), so this one gave strangers the most — they could change the master inventory, not just view it. That's far too many permissions. Therefore, the write access was revoked from the group and other.
```

## Part B — Change the Rings

This is your first time changing permissions, so we follow THE GATEKEEPER'S RULE on every single change: **check who can touch it now, change it, then check again.** That means `ls -l` before *and after* every `chmod`. The simulator's checklist will verify this — a change without both checks will not pass.

### Step 1 — Lock Down the Problem File

The problem file from Part A, Step 3 should not be writable by the group or by other. Fix it: revoke write from group (`g-w`), then revoke both read and write from other. Run `ls -l` before your first change and after your last one.

Commands you ran (in order, including both ls -l checks):

```
ls -l master-inventory.txt
chmod g-w master-inventory.txt
chmod o-rw master-inventory.txt
ls -l master-inventory.txt
```

The file's permission string BEFORE and AFTER:

```
BEFORE: -rw-rw-rw-
AFTER:  -rw-r-----
```

### Step 2 — Make a Script Runnable

The scenario seeds a script (its name ends in `.sh`) that its owner cannot currently execute. Grant the owner execute — and only the owner. Verify with `ls -l` after.

Commands you ran:

```
chmod u+x cleanup.sh
ls -l cleanup.sh
```

Output (the script's corrected permission string):

```
-rwxr--r--
```

### Step 3 — Protect the Secrets File

There's a file whose name makes clear it shouldn't be readable by everyone. Revoke other's read. Verify.

Commands you ran:

```
chmod o-r badge-codes.txt
ls -l badge-codes.txt
```

Output (the corrected permission string):

```
-rw-r-----
```

### Step 4 — Capture Your Audit Evidence (REQUIRED screenshot)

Run one final `ls -l` showing the whole folder with all three fixes in place, and take a screenshot of your simulator session showing it. **This screenshot is required — it is part of ★ Deliverable 1.** Name it `cli-permissions-audit.png`. You'll upload and embed it in the GitHub Commit section below.

## Part C — The Same Story, Windows Edition

### Step 1 — Read One File's Guest List

Switch to the PowerShell side of the scenario and run `Get-Acl` on the seeded file the scenario panel points you to. Windows shows a *list* of named accounts and rights instead of three ring-triplets.

Command you ran:

```
Get-Acl shift-notes.txt
```

Output (the owner line and at least one access entry):

```
Path : shift-notes.txt
Owner : morgan
Access : -rw-r--r--
```

### Step 2 — Translate One Entry

Take one access entry from your output and translate it into plain English, the same way you decoded the Linux string in Part A.

Your plain-English translation:

```
the owner can:read and write
the group can:read 
everyone else can:read 
```

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** In Part A you found the problem file by scanning the *other* triplet. Why is the "other" audience usually the most important one to audit first on a shared system? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
The other triplet means everyone who isn't the owner or in the group, including people outside the organization. If those permissions are too open, anyone who gets access to the system could read or change the file. For security purposes, you audit other permissions first to ensure only the appropriate people have access. This follows the principle of least privilege and grants only the access needed.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** THE GATEKEEPER'S RULE requires a check before *and* after every change, even though `chmod` rarely fails. What does the *before* check protect you from, and what does the *after* check protect you from? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
The before and after checks are a checks-and-balances step that makes sure you actually did what you set out to do. The before check protects you by showing the file's current state, so you know exactly what you're starting with and don't change the wrong thing. The after check protects you by confirming the change actually worked and produced the permissions you intended, instead of assuming it did.
```

**Analysis Question 3.** Lesson 1 called least privilege "granting what's needed and revoking the rest." Pick one of your three fixes from Part B and explain it in least-privilege terms: what was granted that wasn't needed, and who could have taken advantage? *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
In Part B, the master-inventory.txt file gave read and write access to "other," which wasn't needed. That extra write permission meant someone outside the organization, a hacker or criminal, could not just view the file but actually edit it. If they took advantage of that access, they could change the master inventory and/or damage something in the system. Least privilege says "other" should never have had write in the first place, so I revoked it, leaving only the access that was truly needed.
```

**Analysis Question 4.** Windows ACLs can name specific people; Linux permissions use three fixed audiences. Describe one situation where the Windows approach would be genuinely more useful — and one cost of that extra flexibility. *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
Linux only gives you three buckets: owner, group, and other. Windows ACLs are better when lots of different people each need their own level of access, because you can name each person and give them only what they need to do their job (least privilege). The cost is that the list gets long and harder to read than Linux's simple three buckets.
```
